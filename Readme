## Getting Started

Open any of the HTML files directly in a browser, or run a lightweight local server (for example `python3 -m http.server`) and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`.

All navigation links are relative, so the pages work out of the box without additional configuration.

## Publications data

The publications dashboard pulls live data from the [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) API for every CyberHubJo researcher configured in `assets/js/main.js`. Each request includes `info@cyberhubjo.com` as the contact email per OpenAlex requirements. Update the `OPENALEX_CONFIG.authors` array to add or remove members, and the dashboard will automatically recalculate publication counts, citation totals, publication types, and yearly trends on the next page load.
